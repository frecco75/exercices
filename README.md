# Coding Exercices #

My solutions written in Java to coding exercices from :
* [Codility] (https://codility.com)
* [Cracking the coding interview] (https://www.amazon.fr/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Solutions/dp/098478280X)

I use this repo to prepare coding interviews, to review data structures and algorithms etc.
